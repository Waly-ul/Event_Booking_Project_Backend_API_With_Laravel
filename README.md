# Events Booking System Backend API with Laravel

[Project Repository](https://github.com/Waly-ul/Event_Booking_Project_Backend_API_With_Laravel)

## Description
This backend is built using Laravel and acts as a RESTful API provider for a Vue.js frontend(https://github.com/Waly-ul/Event_Booking_Project_Frontend_With_Vue.JS).  
It manages core functionalities such as user authentication and authorization with Laravel Sanctum, and performs CRUD operations on users, events, bookings, and notifications. The backend ensures secure API communication, handles database relationships, validates data, and manages business logic.  

Additionally, it integrates with third-party services for enhanced functionality:  
- **Pusher** for real-time web notifications  
- **Twilio** for sending SMS alerts to users upon successful bookings or admin updates  

API testing is done using Postman, and the database schema follows a well-structured entity-relationship model.
